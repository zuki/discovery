<blockquote>
<p>Discover the world of microcontrollers through <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book is an introductory course on microcontroller-based embedded systems that uses Rust as the
teaching language rather than the usual C/C++.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#scope" id="scope">Scope</a></h2>
<p>The following topics will be covered (eventually, I hope):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to write, build, flash and debug an &quot;embedded&quot; (Rust) program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functionality (&quot;peripherals&quot;) commonly found in microcontrollers: Digital input and output, Pulse
Width Modulation (PWM), Analog to Digital Converters (ADC), common communication protocols like
Serial, I2C and SPI, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multitasking concepts: cooperative vs preemptive multitasking, interrupts, schedulers, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control systems concepts: sensors, calibration, digital filters, actuators, open loop control,
closed loop control, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#approach" id="approach">Approach</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginner friendly. No previous experience with microcontrollers or embedded systems is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hands on. Plenty of exercises to put the theory into practice. <em>You</em> will be doing most of the
work here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tool centered. We'll make plenty use of tooling to ease development. &quot;Real&quot; debugging, with GDB,
and logging will be introduced early on. Using LEDs as a debugging mechanism has no place here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#non-goals" id="non-goals">Non-goals</a></h2>
<p>What's out of scope for this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Teaching Rust. There's plenty of material on that topic already. We'll focus on microcontrollers
and embedded systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being a comprehensive text about electric circuit theory or electronics. We'll just cover the
minimum required to understand how some devices work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covering details such as linker scripts and the boot process. For example, we'll use existing tools
to help get your code onto your board, but not go into detail about how those tools work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also I don't intend to port this material to other development boards; this book will make exclusive
use of the STM32F3DISCOVERY development board.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#background" id="background">Background</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#whats-a-microcontroller" id="whats-a-microcontroller">What's a microcontroller?</a></h2>
<p>A microcontroller is a <em>system</em> on a chip. Whereas your computer is made up of several discrete
components: a processor, RAM sticks, a hard drive, an ethernet port, etc.; a microcontroller has all
those components built into a single &quot;chip&quot; or package. This makes it possible to build systems with
minimal part count.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-can-you-do-with-a-microcontroller" id="what-can-you-do-with-a-microcontroller">What can you do with a microcontroller?</a></h2>
<p>Lots of things! Microcontrollers are the central part of systems known as <em>embedded</em> systems. These
systems are everywhere but you don't usually notice them. These systems control the brakes of your
car, wash your clothes, print your documents, keep you warm, keep you cool, optimize the fuel
consumption of your car, etc.</p>
<p>The main trait of these systems is that they operate without user intervention even if they expose a
user interface like a washing machine does; most of their operation is done on their own.</p>
<p>The other common trait of these systems is that they <em>control</em> a process. And for that these systems
usually have one or more sensors and one or more actuators. For example, an HVAC system has several
sensors, thermometers and humidity sensors spread across some area, and several actuators as well,
heating elements and fans connected to ducts.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#when-should-i-use-a-microcontroller" id="when-should-i-use-a-microcontroller">When should I use a microcontroller?</a></h2>
<p>All these application I've mentioned, you can probably implement with a Raspberry Pi, a computer
that runs Linux. Why should I bother with a microcontroller that operates without an OS? Sounds like
it would be harder to develop a program.</p>
<p>The main reason is cost. A microcontroller is much cheaper than a general purpose computer. Not only
the microcontroller is cheaper; it also requires many fewer external electrical components to
operate. This makes Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) smaller and cheaper to design and manufacture.</p>
<p>The other big reason is power consumption. A microcontroller consumes orders of magnitude less power
than a full blown processor. If your application will run on batteries that makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>And last but not least: (hard) <em>real time</em> constraints. Some processes require their controllers to
respond to some events within some time interval (e.g. a quadcopter/drone hit by a wind gust). If
this <em>deadline</em> is not met, the process could end in catastrophic failure (e.g. the drone crashes to
the ground). A general purpose computer  running a general purpose OS has many services running in
the background. This makes it hard to guarantee execution of a program within tight time constraints.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#when-should-i-not-use-a-microcontroller" id="when-should-i-not-use-a-microcontroller">When should I <em>not</em> use a microcontroller?</a></h2>
<p>Where heavy computations are involved. To keep their power consumption low, microcontrollers have
very limited computational resources available to them. For example, some microcontrollers don't
even have hardware support for floating point operations. On those devices, performing a simple
addition of single precision numbers can take hundreds of CPU cycles.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-use-rust-and-not-c" id="why-use-rust-and-not-c">Why use Rust and not C?</a></h2>
<p>Hopefully, I don't need to convince you here as you are probably familiar with the language
differences between Rust and C. One point I do want to bring up is package management. C lacks an
official, widely accepted package management solution whereas Rust has Cargo. This makes development
<em>much</em> easier. And, IMO, easy package management encourages code reuse because libraries can be
easily integrated into an application which is also a good thing as libraries get more &quot;battle
testing&quot;.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-should-i-not-use-rust" id="why-should-i-not-use-rust">Why should I not use Rust?</a></h2>
<p>Or why should I prefer C over Rust?</p>
<p>The C ecosystem is way more mature. Off the shelf solution for several problems already exist. If
you need to control a time sensitive process, you can grab one of the existing commercial Real Time
Operating Systems (RTOS) out there and solve your problem. There are no commercial, production-grade
RTOSes in Rust yet so you would have to either create one yourself or try one of the ones that are
in development.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#hardwareknowledge-requirements" id="hardwareknowledge-requirements">Hardware/knowledge requirements</a></h1>
<p>The primary knowledge requirement to read this book is to know <em>some</em> Rust. It's
hard for me to quantify <em>some</em> but at least I can tell you that you don't need
to fully grok generics but you do need to know how to <em>use</em> closures. You also
need to be familiar with the idioms of the <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/edition-guide/">2018 edition</a>, in particular with
the fact that <code>extern crate</code> is not necessary in the 2018 edition.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of embedded programming, it will also be extremely helpful to
understand how binary and hexadecimal representations of values work, as well
as the use of some bitwise operators. For example, it would be useful to
understand how the following program produces its output.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = 0x4000_0000 + 0xa2;

    // Use of the bit shift &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; operation.
    let b = 1 &lt;&lt; 5;

    // {:X} will format values as hexadecimal
    println!(&quot;{:X}: {:X}&quot;, a, b);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Also, to follow this material you'll need the following hardware:</p>
<p>(Some components are optional but recommended)</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html">STM32F3DISCOVERY</a> board.</li>
</ul>
<p>(You can purchase this board from &quot;big&quot; <a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/STMicroelectronics/STM32F3DISCOVERY">electronics</a> <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/STM32F3DISCOVERY/497-13192-ND">suppliers</a> or from <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=stm32f3discovery">e-commerce</a>
<a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=stm32f3discovery">sites</a>)</p>
<p align="center">
<img title="STM32F3DISCOVERY" src="02-requirements/../assets/f3.jpg">
</p>
<ul>
<li>OPTIONAL. A <strong>3.3V</strong> USB &lt;-&gt; Serial module. To elaborate: if you have one of
the latest revisions of the discovery board (which is usually the case given
the first revision was released years ago) then you do <em>not</em> need this module
because the board includes this functionality on-board. If you have an older
revision of the board then you'll need this module for chapters 10 and 11. For
completeness, we'll include instructions for using a Serial module. The book
will use <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873">this particular model</a> but you can use any other model as
long as it operates at 3.3V. The CH340G module, which you can buy
from <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=CH340G">e-commerce</a> sites works too and it's probably cheaper for you to get.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
<img title="A 3.3v USB <-> Serial module" src="../assets/serial.jpg">
</p>
<ul>
<li>OPTIONAL. A HC-05 Bluetooth module (with headers!). A HC-06 would work too.</li>
</ul>
<p>(As with other Chinese parts, you pretty much can only find these on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=hc-05">e-commerce</a> <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=hc-05">sites</a>.
(US) Electronics suppliers don't usually stock these for some reason)</p>
<p align="center">
<img title="The HC-05 Bluetooth module" src="02-requirements/../assets/bluetooth.jpg">
</p>
<ul>
<li>Two mini-B USB cables. One is required to make the STM32F3DISCOVERY board work. The other is only
required if you have the Serial &lt;-&gt; USB module. Make sure that the cables both
support data transfer as some cables only support charging devices.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
<img title="mini-B USB cable" src="02-requirements/../assets/usb-cable.jpg">
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> These are <strong>not</strong> the USB cables that ship with pretty much every Android phone; those
are <em>micro</em> USB cables. Make sure you have the right thing!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>MOSTLY OPTIONAL. 5 female to female, 4 male to female and 1 Male to Male <em>jumper</em> (AKA Dupont)
wires. You'll <em>very likely</em> need one female to female to get ITM working. The other wires are only
needed if you'll be using the USB &lt;-&gt; Serial and Bluetooth modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>(You can get these from electronics <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/categories/306">suppliers</a> or from <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=dupont+wire">e-commerce</a> <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=dupont+wire">sites</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong>: Wait, why do I need this specific hardware?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes my life and yours much easier.</p>
<p>The material is much, much more approachable if we don't have to worry about hardware differences.
Trust me on this one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong>: Can I follow this material with a different development board?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe? It depends mainly on two things: your previous experience with microcontrollers and/or
whether there already exists a high level crate, like the <a href="https://docs.rs/f3"><code>f3</code></a>, for your development board
somewhere.</p>
<p>With a different development board, this text would lose most if not all its beginner friendliness
and &quot;easy to follow&quot;-ness, IMO.</p>
<p>If you have a different development board and you don't consider yourself a total beginner, you are
better off starting with the <a href="https://rust-embedded.github.io/cortex-m-quickstart/cortex_m_quickstart/">quickstart</a> project template.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#tools" id="tools">Tools</a></h2>
<p>We'll use all the tools listed below. Where a minimum version is not specified, any recent version
should work but we have listed the version we have tested.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rust 1.31 or a newer toolchain.</p>
</li>

we'll use <code>minicom</code> in this text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>PuTTY</code> on Windows.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your computer has Bluetooth functionality and you have the Bluetooth module, you can additionally
install these tools to play with the Bluetooth module. All these are optional:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux, only if you don't have a Bluetooth manager application like Blueman.
<ul>
<li><code>bluez</code></li>
<li><code>hcitool</code></li>
<li><code>rfcomm</code></li>
<li><code>rfkill</code></li>

<p>Now let's repeat the procedure for the Serial module.</p>
<p>Unplug the F3 and plug the Serial module. Now, figure out what's its associated file:</p>

<p>Let's get familiar with the hardware we'll be working with.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#stm32f3discovery-the-f3" id="stm32f3discovery-the-f3">STM32F3DISCOVERY (the &quot;F3&quot;)</a></h2>
<p align="center">
<img title="F3" src="04-meet-your-hardware/../assets/f3.jpg">
</p>
<p>We'll refer to this board as &quot;F3&quot; throughout this book. Here are some of the
many components on the board:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller">microcontroller</a>.</li>
<li>A number of LEDs, including the eight aligned in a &quot;compass&quot; formation.</li>
<li>Two buttons.</li>
<li>Two USB ports.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer">accelerometer</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer">magnetometer</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope">gyroscope</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these components, the most important is the microcontroller (sometimes
shortened to &quot;MCU&quot; for &quot;microcontroller unit&quot;), which is the large black square
sitting in the center of your board. The MCU is what runs your code. You might
sometimes read about &quot;programming a board&quot;, when in reality what we are doing
is programming the MCU that is installed on the board.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#stm32f303vct6-the-stm32f3" id="stm32f303vct6-the-stm32f3">STM32F303VCT6 (the &quot;STM32F3&quot;)</a></h2>
<p>Since the MCU is so important, let's take a closer look at the one sitting on our board.</p>
<p>Our MCU is surrounded by 100 tiny metal <strong>pins</strong>. These pins are connected to
<strong>traces</strong>, the little &quot;roads&quot; that act as the wires connecting components
together on the board. The MCU can dynamically alter the electrical properties
of the pins. This works similar to a light switch altering how electrical
current flows through a circuit. By enabling or disabling electrical current to
flow through a specific pin, an LED attached to that pin (via the traces) can
be turned on and off.</p>
<p>Each manufacturer uses a different part numbering scheme, but many will allow
you to determine information about a component simply by looking at the part
number. Looking at our MCU's part number (<code>STM32F303VCT6</code>), the <code>ST</code> at the
front hints to us that this is a part manufactured by <a href="https://st.com/">ST Microelectronics</a>.
Searching through <a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-mainstream-mcus.html">ST's marketing materials</a> we can also learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>M32</code> represents that this is an Arm®-based 32-bit microcontroller.</li>
<li>The <code>F3</code> represents that the MCU is from ST's &quot;STM32F3&quot; series. This is a
series of MCUs based on the Cortex®-M4 processor design.</li>
<li>The remainder of the part number goes into more details about things like
extra features and RAM size, which at this point we're less concerned about.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h3><a class="header" href="#arm-cortex-m4" id="arm-cortex-m4">Arm? Cortex-M4?</a></h3>
<p>If our chip is manufactured by ST, then who is Arm? And if our chip is the
STM32F3, what is the Cortex-M4?</p>
<p>You might be surprised to hear that while &quot;Arm-based&quot; chips are quite
popular, the company behind the &quot;Arm&quot; trademark (<a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm Holdings</a>) doesn't
actually manufacture chips for purchase. Instead, their primary business
model is to just <em>design</em> parts of chips. They will then license those designs to
manufacturers, who will in turn implement the designs (perhaps with some of
their own tweaks) in the form of physical hardware that can then be sold.
Arm's strategy here is different from companies like Intel, which both
designs <em>and</em> manufactures their chips.</p>
<p>Arm licenses a bunch of different designs. Their &quot;Cortex-M&quot; family of designs
are mainly used as the core in microcontrollers. For example, the Cortex-M0
is designed for low cost and low power usage. The Cortex-M7 is higher cost,
but with more features and performance. The core of our STM32F3 is based on
the Cortex-M4, which is in the middle: more features and performance than the
Cortex-M0, but less expensive than the Cortex-M7.</p>
<p>Luckily, you don't need to know too much about different types of processors
or Cortex designs for the sake of this book. However, you are hopefully now a
bit more knowledgeable about the terminology of your device. While you are
working specifically with an STM32F3, you might find yourself reading
documentation and using tools for Cortex-M-based chips, as the STM32F3 is
based on a Cortex-M design.</p>

<p align="center">
<img title="Serial module" src="04-meet-your-hardware/../assets/serial.jpg">
</p>
<p>If you have an older revision of the discovery board, you can use this module to
exchange data between the microcontroller in the F3 and your computer. This module
will be connected to your computer using an USB cable. I won't say more at this
point.</p>
<p>If you have a newer release of the board then you don't need this module. The
ST-LINK will double as a USB&lt;-&gt;serial converter connected to the microcontroller USART1 at pins PC4 and PC5.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#led-roulette" id="led-roulette">LED roulette</a></h1>
<p>Alright, let's start by building the following application:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0k1r2Lc.gif">
</p>
<p>I'm going to give you a high level API to implement this app but don't worry we'll do low level
stuff later on. The main goal of this chapter is to get familiar with the <em>flashing</em> and debugging
process.</p>
<p>Throughout this text we'll be using the starter code that's in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/discovery">discovery</a> repository. Make sure
you always have the latest version of the master branch because this website tracks that branch.</p>
<p>The starter code is in the <code>src</code> directory of that repository. Inside that directory there are more
directories named after each chapter of this book. Most of those directories are starter Cargo
projects.</p>
<p>Now, jump into the <code>src/05-led-roulette</code> directory. Check the <code>src/main.rs</code> file:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#![deny(unsafe_code)]
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

use aux5::entry;

#[entry]
fn main() -&gt; ! {
    let _y;
    let x = 42;
    _y = x;

    // infinite loop; just so we don't leave this stack frame
    loop {}
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Microcontroller programs are different from standard programs in two aspects: <code>#![no_std]</code> and
<code>#![no_main]</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>no_std</code> attribute says that this program won't use the <code>std</code> crate, which assumes an underlying
OS; the program will instead use the <code>core</code> crate, a subset of <code>std</code> that can run on bare metal
systems (i.e., systems without OS abstractions like files and sockets).</p>
<p>The <code>no_main</code> attribute says that this program won't use the standard <code>main</code> interface, which is
tailored for command line applications that receive arguments. Instead of the standard <code>main</code> we'll
use the <code>entry</code> attribute from the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rt"><code>cortex-m-rt</code></a> crate to define a custom entry point. In this
program we have named the entry point &quot;main&quot;, but any other name could have been used. The entry
point function must have signature <code>fn() -&gt; !</code>; this type indicates that the function can't return
-- this means that the program never terminates.</p>
<p>If you are a careful observer, you'll also notice there is a <code>.cargo</code> directory in the Cargo project
as well. This directory contains a Cargo configuration file (<code>.cargo/config</code>) that tweaks the
linking process to tailor the memory layout of the program to the requirements of the target device.
This modified linking process is a requirement of the <code>cortex-m-rt</code> crate.</p>
<p>Alright, let's start by building this program.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#build-it" id="build-it">Build it</a></h1>
<p>The first step is to build our &quot;binary&quot; crate. Because the microcontroller has a different
architecture than your computer we'll have to cross compile. Cross compiling in Rust land is as simple
as passing an extra <code>--target</code> flag to <code>rustc</code>or Cargo. The complicated part is figuring out the
argument of that flag: the <em>name</em> of the target.</p>
<p>The microcontroller in the F3 has a Cortex-M4F processor in it. <code>rustc</code> knows how to cross compile
to the Cortex-M architecture and provides 4 different targets that cover the different processor
families within that architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>thumbv6m-none-eabi</code>, for the Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M1 processors</li>
<li><code>thumbv7m-none-eabi</code>, for the Cortex-M3 processor</li>
<li><code>thumbv7em-none-eabi</code>, for the Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 processors</li>
<li><code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code>, for the Cortex-M4<strong>F</strong> and Cortex-M7<strong>F</strong> processors</li>
</ul>
<p>For the F3, we'll use the <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code> target. Before cross compiling you have to
download pre-compiled version of the standard library (a reduced version of it actually) for your
target. That's done using <code>rustup</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
</code></pre>
<p>You only need to do the above step once; <code>rustup</code> will re-install a new standard library
(<code>rust-std</code> component) whenever you update your toolchain.</p>
<p>With the <code>rust-std</code> component in place you can now cross compile the program using Cargo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # make sure you are in the `src/05-led-roulette` directory

$ cargo build --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Be sure to compile this crate <em>without</em> optimizations. The provided Cargo.toml file and build command above will ensure optimizations are off. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, now we have produced an executable. This executable won't blink any leds, it's just a simplified version that we will build upon later in the chapter. As a sanity check, let's verify that the produced executable is actually an ARM binary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # equivalent to `readelf -h target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette`
$ cargo readobj --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf --bin led-roulette -- -file-headers

  Number of section headers:         20
  Section header string table index: 18
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we'll flash the program into our microcontroller.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#flash-it" id="flash-it">Flash it</a></h1>
<p>Flashing is the process of moving our program into the microcontroller's (persistent) memory. Once
flashed, the microcontroller will execute the flashed program every time it is powered on.</p>
<p>In this case, our <code>led-roulette</code> program will be the <em>only</em> program in the microcontroller memory.
By this I mean that there's nothing else running on the microcontroller: no OS, no &quot;daemon&quot;,
nothing. <code>led-roulette</code> has full control over the device.</p>
<p>Onto the actual flashing. First thing we need is to do is launch OpenOCD. We did that in the
previous section but this time we'll run the command inside a temporary directory (<code>/tmp</code> on *nix;
<code>%TEMP%</code> on Windows).</p>
<p>Make sure the F3 is connected to your computer and run the following commands on a new terminal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # *nix
$ cd /tmp

$ # Windows
$ cd %TEMP%

$ # Windows: remember that you need an extra `-s %PATH_TO_OPENOCD%\share\scripts`
$ openocd \
  -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg \
  -f target/stm32f3x.cfg
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Older revisions of the board need to pass slightly different arguments to
<code>openocd</code>. Review <a href="05-led-roulette/../03-setup/verify.html#first-openocd-connection">this section</a> for the details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The program will block; leave that terminal open.</p>
<p>Now it's a good time to explain what this command is actually doing.</p>
<p>I mentioned that the F3 actually has two microcontrollers. One of them is used as a
programmer/debugger. The part of the board that's used as a programmer is called ST-LINK (that's what
STMicroelectronics decided to call it). This ST-LINK is connected to the target microcontroller
using a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface (this interface is an ARM standard so you'll run into it
when dealing with other Cortex-M based microcontrollers). This SWD interface can be used to flash
and debug a microcontroller. The ST-LINK is connected to the &quot;USB ST-LINK&quot; port and will appear as
a USB device when you connect the F3 to your computer.</p>
<p align="center">
<img height=640 title="On-board ST-LINK" src="05-led-roulette/../assets/st-link.png">
</p>
<p>As for OpenOCD, it's software that provides some services like a <em>GDB server</em> on top of USB
devices that expose a debugging protocol like SWD or JTAG.</p>
<p>Onto the actual command: those <code>.cfg</code> files we are using instruct OpenOCD to look for a ST-LINK USB
device (<code>interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg</code>) and to expect a STM32F3XX microcontroller
(<code>target/stm32f3x.cfg</code>) to be connected to the ST-LINK.</p>
<p>The OpenOCD output looks like this:</p>

<p>The &quot;6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints&quot; part indicates the debugging features the processor has
available.</p>
<p>Leave that <code>openocd</code> process running, and open a new terminal. Make sure that you are inside the project's <code>src/05-led-roulette/</code> directory.</p>
<p>I mentioned that OpenOCD provides a GDB server so let's connect to that right now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ &lt;gdb&gt; -q target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette
Reading symbols from target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/led-roulette...done.
(gdb)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <code>&lt;gdb&gt;</code> represents a GDB program capable of debugging ARM binaries.
This could be <code>arm-none-eabi-gdb</code>, <code>gdb-multiarch</code> or <code>gdb</code> depending on your
system -- you may have to try all three.</p>
<p>This only opens a GDB shell. To actually connect to the OpenOCD GDB server, use the following
command within the GDB shell:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) target remote :3333
Remote debugging using :3333
0x00000000 in ?? ()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you are getting errors like <code>undefined debug reason 7 - target needs reset</code>, you can try running <code>monitor reset halt</code> as described <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38994596/reason-7-target-needs-reset-unreliable-debugging-setup">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If the debugger is still not connecting to the OpenOCD server, then you may need to try using <code>arm-none-eabi-gdb</code> instead of the <code>gdb</code> command, as described above.</p>
<p>By default OpenOCD's GDB server listens on TCP port 3333 (localhost). This command is connecting to
that port.</p>
<p>After entering this command, you'll see new output in the OpenOCD terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> Info : stm32f3x.cpu: hardware has 6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints

</code></pre>
<p>Almost there. To flash the device, we'll use the <code>load</code> command inside the GDB shell:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) load

<p>Breakpoints can be used to stop the normal flow of a program. The <code>continue</code> command will let the
program run freely <em>until</em> it reaches a breakpoint. In this case, until it reaches the <code>main</code>
function because there's a breakpoint there.</p>
<p>Note that GDB output says &quot;Breakpoint 1&quot;. Remember that our processor can only use six of these
breakpoints so it's a good idea to pay attention to these messages.</p>
<p>For a nicer debugging experience, we'll be using GDB's Text User Interface (TUI). To enter into that
mode, on the GDB shell enter the following command:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) layout src
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Apologies Windows users. The GDB shipped with the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain doesn't
support this TUI mode <code>:-(</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="05-led-roulette/../assets/gdb-layout-src.png" alt="GDB session" title="GDB TUI" /></p>
<p>At any point you can leave the TUI mode using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) tui disable
</code></pre>
<p>OK. We are now at the beginning of <code>main</code>. We can advance the program statement by statement using
the <code>step</code> command. So let's use that twice to reach the <code>_y = x</code> statement. Once you've typed <code>step</code>
once you can just hit enter to run it
again.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) step
14           _y = x;
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not using the TUI mode, on each <code>step</code> call GDB will print back the current statement
along with its line number.</p>
<p>We are now &quot;on&quot; the <code>_y = x</code> statement; that statement hasn't been executed yet. This means that <code>x</code>
is initialized but <code>_y</code> is not. Let's inspect those stack/local variables using the <code>print</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print x
$1 = 42

(gdb) print &amp;x
$2 = (i32 *) 0x10001ff4

(gdb) print _y
$3 = -536810104

(gdb) print &amp;_y
$4 = (i32 *) 0x10001ff0
</code></pre>
<p>As expected, <code>x</code> contains the value <code>42</code>. <code>_y</code>, however, contains the value <code>-536810104</code> (?). Because
<code>_y</code> has not been initialized yet, it contains some garbage value.</p>
<p>The command <code>print &amp;x</code> prints the address of the variable <code>x</code>. The interesting bit here is that GDB
output shows the type of the reference: <code>i32*</code>, a pointer to an <code>i32</code> value. Another interesting
thing is that the addresses of <code>x</code> and <code>_y</code> are very close to each other: their addresses are just
<code>4</code> bytes apart.</p>
<p>Instead of printing the local variables one by one, you can also use the <code>info locals</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info locals
x = 42
_y = -536810104
</code></pre>
<p>OK. With another <code>step</code>, we'll be on top of the <code>loop {}</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) step
17          loop {}
</code></pre>
<p>And <code>_y</code> should now be initialized.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print _y
$5 = 42
</code></pre>
<p>If we use <code>step</code> again on top of the <code>loop {}</code> statement, we'll get stuck because the program will
never pass that statement. Instead, we'll switch to the disassemble view with the <code>layout asm</code>
command and advance one instruction at a time using <code>stepi</code>. You can always switch back into Rust
source code view later by issuing the <code>layout src</code> command again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> If you used the <code>step</code> command by mistake and GDB got stuck, you can get unstuck by hitting <code>Ctrl+C</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>(gdb) layout asm
</code></pre>
<p><img src="05-led-roulette/../assets/gdb-layout-asm.png" alt="GDB session" title="GDB disassemble" /></p>
<p>If you are not using the TUI mode, you can use the <code>disassemble /m</code> command to disassemble the
program around the line you are currently at.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) disassemble /m

<p>See the fat arrow <code>=&gt;</code> on the left side? It shows the instruction the processor will execute next.</p>

<p>One last trick before we move to something more interesting. Enter the following commands into GDB:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) monitor reset halt

(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, main () at src/05-led-roulette/src/main.rs:10
10          let x = 42;
</code></pre>
<p>We are now back at the beginning of <code>main</code>!</p>
<p><code>monitor reset halt</code> will reset the microcontroller and stop it right at the program entry point.
The following <code>continue</code> command will let the program run freely until it reaches the <code>main</code>
function that has a breakpoint on it.</p>
<p>This combo is handy when you, by mistake, skipped over a part of the program that you were
interested in inspecting. You can easily roll back the state of your program back to its very
beginning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The fine print</strong>: This <code>reset</code> command doesn't clear or touch RAM. That memory will retain its
values from the previous run. That shouldn't be a problem though, unless your program behavior
depends of the value of <em>uninitialized</em> variables but that's the definition of Undefined Behavior
(UB).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are done with this debug session. You can end it with the <code>quit</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) quit

</blockquote>
<p>Don't close OpenOCD though! We'll use it again and again later on. It's better
just to leave it running.</p>
<p>What's next? The high level API I promised.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-led-and-delay-abstractions" id="the-led-and-delay-abstractions">The <code>Led</code> and <code>Delay</code> abstractions</a></h1>
<p>Now, I'm going to introduce two high level abstractions that we'll use to implement the LED roulette
application.</p>
<p>The auxiliary crate, <code>aux5</code>, exposes an initialization function called <code>init</code>. When called this
function returns two values packed in a tuple: a <code>Delay</code> value and a <code>Leds</code> value.</p>
<p><code>Delay</code> can be used to block your program for a specified amount of milliseconds.</p>
<p><code>Leds</code> is actually an array of eight <code>Led</code>s. Each <code>Led</code> represents one of the LEDs on the F3 board,
and exposes two methods: <code>on</code> and <code>off</code> which can be used to turn the LED on or off, respectively.</p>
<p>Let's try out these two abstractions by modifying the starter code to look like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#![deny(unsafe_code)]
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

use aux5::{entry, prelude::*, Delay, Leds};

#[entry]
fn main() -&gt; ! {
    let (mut delay, mut leds): (Delay, Leds) = aux5::init();

    let half_period = 500_u16;

    loop {
        leds[0].on();
        delay.delay_ms(half_period);

        leds[0].off();
        delay.delay_ms(half_period);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now build it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo build --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> It's possible to forget to rebuild the program <em>before</em> starting a GDB session; this
omission can lead to very confusing debug sessions. To avoid this problem you can call <code>cargo run</code>
instead of <code>cargo build</code>; <code>cargo run</code> will build <em>and</em> start a debug session ensuring you never
forget to recompile your program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we'll repeat the flashing procedure that we did in the previous section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # this starts a GDB session of the program; no need to specify the path to the binary

</code></pre>
<p>OK. Let's step through the code. This time, we'll use the <code>next</code> command instead of <code>step</code>. The
difference is that the <code>next</code> command will step <em>over</em> function calls instead of going inside them.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) next
11          let half_period = 500_u16;

(gdb) next
13          loop {

(gdb) next
14              leds[0].on();

(gdb) next
15              delay.delay_ms(half_period);
</code></pre>
<p>After executing the <code>leds[0].on()</code> statement, you should see a red LED, the one pointing North,
turn on.</p>
<p>Let's continue stepping over the program:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) next
17              leds[0].off();

(gdb) next
18              delay.delay_ms(half_period);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>delay_ms</code> call will block the program for half a second but you may not notice because the
<code>next</code> command also takes some time to execute. However, after stepping over the <code>leds[0].off()</code>
statement you should see the red LED turn off.</p>
<p>You can already guess what this program does. Let it run uninterrupted using the <code>continue</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) continue
Continuing.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's do something more interesting. We are going to modify the behavior of our program using
GDB.</p>
<p>First, let's stop the infinite loop by hitting <code>Ctrl+C</code>. You'll probably end up somewhere inside
<code>Led::on</code>, <code>Led::off</code> or <code>delay_ms</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.

472     /checkout/src/libcore/ptr.rs: No such file or directory.
</code></pre>
<p>In my case, the program stopped its execution inside a <code>read_volatile</code> function. GDB output shows
some interesting information about that: <code>core::ptr::read_volatile (src=0xe000e010)</code>. This means
that the function comes from the <code>core</code> crate and that it was called with argument <code>src = 0xe000e010</code>.</p>
<p>Just so you know, a more explicit way to show the arguments of a function is to use the <code>info args</code>
command:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) info args
src = 0xe000e010
</code></pre>
<p>Regardless of where your program may have stopped you can always look at the output of the
<code>backtrace</code> command (<code>bt</code> for short) to learn how it got there:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) backtrace

<pre><code>(gdb) info locals
half_period = 500

<p>If you let program run free again using the <code>continue</code> command, you should see that the LED will
blink at a much faster rate now!</p>
<p>Question! What happens if you keep lowering the value of <code>half_period</code>? At what value of
<code>half_period</code> you can no longer see the LED blink?</p>
<p>Now, it's your turn to write a program.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-challenge" id="the-challenge">The challenge</a></h1>
<p>You are now well armed to face a challenge! Your task will be to implement the application I showed
you at the beginning of this chapter.</p>
<p>Here's the GIF again:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0k1r2Lc.gif">
</p>
<p>Also, this may help:</p>
<p align="center">
<img class="white_bg" src="05-led-roulette/../assets/timing-diagram.png">
</p>
<p>This is a timing diagram. It indicates which LED is on at any given instant of time and for how long
each LED should be on. On the X axis we have the time in milliseconds. The timing diagram shows a
single period. This pattern will repeat itself every 800 ms. The Y axis labels each LED with a
cardinal point: North, East, etc. As part of the challenge you'll have to figure out how each
element in the <code>Leds</code> array maps to these cardinal points (hint: <code>cargo doc --open</code> <code>;-)</code>).</p>
<p>Before you attempt this challenge, let me give you one last tip. Our GDB sessions always involve
entering the same commands at the beginning. We can use a <code>.gdb</code> file to execute some commands
right after GDB is started. This way you can save yourself the effort of having to enter them
manually on each GDB session.</p>
<p>Place this <code>openocd.gdb</code> file in the root of the Cargo project, right next to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cat openocd.gdb
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">target remote :3333
load
break main
continue
</code></pre>
<p>Then modify the second line of the <code>.cargo/config</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cat .cargo/config
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.thumbv7em-none-eabihf]
runner = &quot;arm-none-eabi-gdb -q -x openocd.gdb&quot; # &lt;-
rustflags = [
  &quot;-C&quot;, &quot;link-arg=-Tlink.x&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>With that in place, you should now be able to start a <code>gdb</code> session that will automatically flash
the program and jump to the beginning of <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf

<p>Know how to read this output? The <code>text</code> section contains the program instructions. It's around 2KB
in my case. On the other hand, the <code>data</code> and <code>bss</code> sections contain variables statically allocated
in RAM (<code>static</code> variables). A <code>static</code> variable is being used in <code>aux5::init</code>; that's why it shows 4
bytes of <code>bss</code>.</p>
<p>One final thing! We have been running our programs from within GDB but our programs don't depend on
GDB at all. You can confirm this be closing both GDB and OpenOCD and then resetting the board by
pressing the black button on the board. The LED roulette application will run without intervention
of GDB.</p>

<hr />
<p>Just a little more of helpful magic before we start doing low level stuff.</p>
<p>Blinking an LED is like the &quot;Hello, world&quot; of the embedded world.</p>
<p>But in this section, we'll run a proper &quot;Hello, world&quot; program that prints stuff to your computer
console.</p>
<p>Go to the <code>06-hello-world</code> directory. There's some starter code in it:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#![deny(unsafe_code)]
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

#[allow(unused_imports)]
use aux6::{entry, iprint, iprintln};

#[entry]
fn main() -&gt; ! {
    let mut itm = aux6::init();

    iprintln!(&amp;mut itm.stim[0], &quot;Hello, world!&quot;);

    loop {}
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>iprintln</code> macro will format messages and output them to the microcontroller's <em>ITM</em>. ITM stands
for Instrumentation Trace Macrocell and it's a communication protocol on top of SWD (Serial Wire
Debug) which can be used to send messages from the microcontroller to the debugging host. This
communication is only <em>one way</em>: the debugging host can't send data to the microcontroller.</p>
<p>OpenOCD, which is managing the debug session, can receive data sent through this ITM <em>channel</em> and
redirect it to a file.</p>
<p>The ITM protocol works with <em>frames</em> (you can think of them as Ethernet frames). Each frame has a
header and a variable length payload. OpenOCD will receive these frames and write them directly to a
file without parsing them. So, if the microntroller sends the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot; using the
<code>iprintln</code> macro, OpenOCD's output file won't exactly contain that string.</p>
<p>To retrieve the original string, OpenOCD's output file will have to be parsed. We'll use the
<code>itmdump</code> program to perform the parsing as new data arrives.</p>
<p>You should have already installed the <code>itmdump</code> program during the <a href="06-hello-world/../03-setup/index.html#itmdump">installation chapter</a>.</p>
<p>In a new terminal, run this command inside the <code>/tmp</code> directory, if you are using a *nix OS, or from
within the <code>%TEMP%</code> directory, if you are running Windows. This should be the same directory from
where you are running OpenOCD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> It's very important that both <code>itmdump</code> and <code>openocd</code> are running
from the same directory!</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # itmdump terminal

$ # *nix
$ cd /tmp &amp;&amp; touch itm.txt

$ # Windows
$ cd %TEMP% &amp;&amp; type nul &gt;&gt; itm.txt

$ # both
$ itmdump -F -f itm.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This command will block as <code>itmdump</code> is now watching the <code>itm.txt</code> file. Leave this terminal open.</p>
<p>Make sure that F3 is connected to your computer. Open another terminal from <code>/tmp</code> directory (on Windows <code>%TEMP%</code>) to launch OpenOCD similar as described in chapter <a href="06-hello-world/../03-setup/verify.html#first-openocd-connection">First OpenOCD connection</a>.</p>
<p>Alright. Now, let's build the starter code and flash it into the microcontroller.</p>
<p>To avoid passing the <code>--target thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code> flag to every Cargo invocation we can set a
default target in .cargo/config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> [target.thumbv7em-none-eabihf]
 runner = &quot;arm-none-eabi-gdb -q -x openocd.gdb&quot;
 rustflags = [
   &quot;-C&quot;, &quot;link-arg=-Tlink.x&quot;,
 ]

+[build]
+target = &quot;thumbv7em-none-eabihf&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now if <code>--target</code> is not specified Cargo will assume that the target is <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

<p>Note that there's a <code>openocd.gdb</code> at the root of the Cargo project. It's pretty similar to the one we
used in the previous section.</p>
<p>Before we execute the <code>iprintln!</code> statement. We have to instruct OpenOCD to redirect the ITM output
into the same file that <code>itmdump</code> is watching.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) # globally enable the ITM and redirect all output to itm.txt

<p>All should be ready! Now execute the <code>iprintln!</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) next

<p>Awesome, right? Feel free to use <code>iprintln</code> as a logging tool in the coming sections.</p>
<p>Next: That's not all! The <code>iprint!</code> macros are not the only thing that uses the ITM. <code>:-)</code></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#panic" id="panic"><code>panic!</code></a></h1>
<p>The <code>panic!</code> macro also sends its output to the ITM!</p>
<p>Change the <code>main</code> function to look like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[entry]
fn main() -&gt; ! {
    panic!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's try this program. But before that let's update <code>openocd.gdb</code> to run that <code>monitor</code> stuff for
us during GDB startup:</p>

<p>What's this magic?</p>
<p>The address <code>0x48001018</code> points to a <em>register</em>. A register is a special region of memory that
controls a <em>peripheral</em>. A peripheral is a piece of electronics that sits right next to the
processor within the microcontroller package and provides the processor with extra functionality.
After all, the processor, on its own, can only do math and logic.</p>
<p>This particular register controls General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) <em>pins</em> (GPIO <em>is</em> a
peripheral) and can be used to <em>drive</em> each of those pins <em>low</em> or <em>high</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#an-aside-leds-digital-outputs-and-voltage-levels" id="an-aside-leds-digital-outputs-and-voltage-levels">An aside: LEDs, digital outputs and voltage levels</a></h2>
<p>Drive? Pin? Low? High?</p>
<p>A pin is a electrical contact. Our microcontroller has several of them and some of them are
connected to LEDs. An LED, a Light Emitting Diode, will only emit light when voltage is applied to
it with a certain polarity.</p>
<p align="center">
<img class="white_bg" height=180 title="LED circuit" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/LED_circuit.svg">
</p>
<p>Luckily for us, the microcontroller's pins are connected to the LEDs with the right polarity. All
that we have to do is <em>output</em> some non-zero voltage through the pin to turn the LED on. The pins
attached to the LEDs are configured as <em>digital outputs</em> and can only output two different voltage
levels: &quot;low&quot;, 0 Volts, or &quot;high&quot;, 3 Volts. A &quot;high&quot; (voltage) level will turn the LED on whereas
a &quot;low&quot; (voltage) level will turn it off.</p>
<p>These &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; states map directly to the concept of digital logic. &quot;low&quot; is <code>0</code> or <code>false</code>
and &quot;high&quot; is <code>1</code> or <code>true</code>. This is why this pin configuration is known as digital output.</p>
<hr />
<p>OK. But how can one find out what this register does? Time to RTRM (Read the Reference Manual)!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#rtrm-reading-the-reference-manual" id="rtrm-reading-the-reference-manual">RTRM: Reading The Reference Manual</a></h1>
<p>I mentioned that the microcontroller has several pins. For convenience, these pins are grouped in
<em>ports</em> of 16 pins. Each port is named with a letter: Port A, Port B, etc. and the pins within each
port are named with numbers from 0 to 15.</p>
<p>The first thing we have to find out is which pin is connected to which LED. This information is in
the STM32F3DISCOVERY <a href="http://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00063382.pdf">User Manual</a> (You downloaded a copy, right?). In this particular section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 6.4 LEDs - Page 18</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The manual says:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LD3</code>, the North LED, is connected to the pin <code>PE9</code>. <code>PE9</code> is the short form of: Pin 9 on Port E.</li>
<li><code>LD7</code>, the East LED, is connected to the pin <code>PE11</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to this point, we know that we want to change the state of the pins PE9 and PE11 to turn the
North/East LEDs on/off. These pins are part of Port E so we'll have to deal with the <code>GPIOE</code>
peripheral.</p>
<p>Each peripheral has a register <em>block</em> associated to it. A register block is a collection of
registers allocated in contiguous memory. The address at which the register block starts is known as
its base address. We need to figure out what's the base address of the <code>GPIOE</code> peripheral. That
information is in the following section of the microcontroller <a href="http://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00043574.pdf">Reference Manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 3.2.2 Memory map and register boundary addresses - Page 51</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The table says that base address of the <code>GPIOE</code> register block is <code>0x4800_1000</code>.</p>
<p>Each peripheral also has its own section in the documentation. Each of these sections ends with a
table of the registers that the peripheral's register block contains. For the <code>GPIO</code> family of
peripheral, that table is in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 11.4.12 GPIO register map - Page 243</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are interested in the register that's at an offset of <code>0x18</code> from the base address of the <code>GPIOE</code>
peripheral. According to the table, that would be the register <code>BSRR</code>.</p>
<p>Now we need to jump to the documentation of that particular register. It's a few pages above in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 11.4.7 GPIO port bit set/reset register (GPIOx_BSRR) - Page 240</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally!</p>
<p>This is the register we were writing to. The documentation says some interesting things. First, this
register is write only ... so let's try reading its value <code>:-)</code>.</p>
<p>We'll use GDB's <code>examine</code> command: <code>x</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) next
16              *(GPIOE_BSRR as *mut u32) = 1 &lt;&lt; 9;

(gdb) x 0x48001018
0x48001018:     0x00000000

(gdb) # the next command will turn the North LED on
(gdb) next
19              *(GPIOE_BSRR as *mut u32) = 1 &lt;&lt; 11;

(gdb) x 0x48001018
0x48001018:     0x00000000
</code></pre>
<p>Reading the register returns <code>0</code>. That matches what the documentation says.</p>
<p>The other thing that the documentation says is that the bits 0 to 15 can be used to <em>set</em> the
corresponding pin. That is bit 0 sets the pin 0. Here, <em>set</em> means outputting a <em>high</em> value on
the pin.</p>
<p>The documentation also says that bits 16 to 31 can be used to <em>reset</em> the corresponding pin. In this
case, the bit 16 resets the pin number 0. As you may guess, <em>reset</em> means outputting a <em>low</em> value
on the pin.</p>
<p>Correlating that information with our program, all seems to be in agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Writing <code>1 &lt;&lt; 9</code> (<code>BS9 = 1</code>)  to <code>BSRR</code>  sets <code>PE9</code> <em>high</em>. That turns the North LED <em>on</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing <code>1 &lt;&lt; 11</code> (<code>BS11 = 1</code>) to <code>BSRR</code> sets <code>PE11</code> <em>high</em>. That turns the East LED <em>on</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing <code>1 &lt;&lt; 25</code> (<code>BR9 = 1</code>) to <code>BSRR</code> sets <code>PE9</code> <em>low</em>. That turns the North LED <em>off</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, writing <code>1 &lt;&lt; 27</code> (<code>BR11 = 1</code>) to <code>BSRR</code> sets <code>PE11</code> <em>low</em>. That turns the East LED <em>off</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#misoptimization" id="misoptimization">(mis)Optimization</a></h1>
<p>Reads/writes to registers are quite special. I may even dare to say that they are embodiment of side
effects. In the previous example we wrote four different values to the same register. If you didn't
know that address was a register, you may have simplified the logic to just write the final value <code>1 &lt;&lt; (11 + 16)</code> into the register.</p>
<p>Actually, LLVM, the compiler's backend / optimizer, does not know we are dealing with a register and
will merge the writes thus changing the behavior of our program. Let's check that really quick.</p>

<p>The state of the LEDs didn't change this time! The <code>str</code> instruction is the one that writes a value

<p>We tried to do an invalid operation, reading memory that doesn't exist, so the processor raised an
<em>exception</em>, a <em>hardware</em> exception.</p>
<p>In most cases, exceptions are raised when the processor attempts to perform an invalid operation.
Exceptions break the normal flow of a program and force the processor to execute an <em>exception
handler</em>, which is just a function/subroutine.</p>
<p>There are different kind of exceptions. Each kind of exception is raised by different conditions and
each one is handled by a different exception handler.</p>
<p>The <code>aux7</code> crate depends on the <code>cortex-m-rt</code> crate which defines a default
<em>hard fault</em> handler, named <code>UserHardFault</code>, that handles the &quot;invalid memory
address&quot; exception. <code>openocd.gdb</code> placed a breakpoint on <code>HardFault</code>; that's why
the debugger halted your program while it was executing the exception handler.
We can get more information about the exception from the debugger. Let's see:</p>

<p>The exception was caused by the <code>ldr r0, [r0, #0]</code> instruction, a read instruction. The instruction
tried to read the memory at the address indicated by the <code>r0</code> register. By the way, <code>r0</code> is a CPU
(processor) register not a memory mapped register; it doesn't have an associated address like, say,
<code>GPIO_BSRR</code>.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if we could check what the value of the <code>r0</code> register was right at the instant
when the exception was raised? Well, we already did! The <code>r0</code> field in the <code>ef</code> value we printed
before is the value of <code>r0</code> register had when the exception was raised. Here it is again:</p>

<p>Side effects! Although we are reading the same address multiple times without actually modifying it,
we still see its value change every time <code>BSRR</code> is written to.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#type-safe-manipulation" id="type-safe-manipulation">Type safe manipulation</a></h1>
<p>The last register we were working with, <code>ODR</code>, had this in its documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bits 31:16 Reserved, must be kept at reset value</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not supposed to write to those bits of the register or Bad Stuff May Happen.</p>
<p>There's also the fact the registers have different read/write permissions. Some of them are write
only, others can be read and written to and there must be others that are read only.</p>
<p>Finally, directly working with hexadecimal addresses is error prone. You already saw that trying to
access an invalid memory address causes an exception which disrupts the execution of our program.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if we had an API to manipulate registers in a &quot;safe&quot; manner? Ideally, the API
should encode these three points I've mentioned: No messing around with the actual addresses, should
respect read/write permissions and should prevent modification of the reserved parts of a register.</p>
<p>Well, we do! <code>aux7::init()</code> actually returns a value that provides a type safe API to manipulate the
registers of the  <code>GPIOE</code> peripheral.</p>
<p>As you may remember: a group of registers associated to a peripheral is called register block, and
it's located in a contiguous region of memory. In this type safe API each register block is modeled
as a <code>struct</code> where each of its fields represents a register. Each register field is a different
newtype over e.g. <code>u32</code> that exposes a combination of the following methods: <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> or
<code>modify</code> according to its read/write permissions. Finally, these methods don't take primitive values
like <code>u32</code>, instead they take yet another newtype that can be constructed using the builder pattern
and that prevent the modification of the reserved parts of the register.</p>
<p>The best way to get familiar with this API is to port our running example to it.</p>

<p>First thing you notice: There are no magic addresses involved. Instead we use a more human friendly
way, for example <code>gpioe.bsrr</code>, to refer to the <code>BSRR</code> register in the <code>GPIOE</code> register block.</p>
<p>Then we have this <code>write</code> method that takes a closure. If the identity closure (<code>|w| w</code>) is used,
this method will set the register to its <em>default</em> (reset) value, the value it had right after the
microcontroller was powered on / reset. That value is <code>0x0</code> for the <code>BSRR</code> register. Since we want
to write a non-zero value to the register, we use builder methods like <code>bs9</code> and <code>br9</code> to set some
of the bits of the default value.</p>
<p>Let's run this program! There's some interesting stuff we can do <em>while</em> debugging the program.</p>
<p><code>gpioe</code> is a reference to the <code>GPIOE</code> register block. <code>print gpioe</code> will return the base address of
the register block.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run
Breakpoint 3, main () at src/07-registers/src/main.rs:9

(gdb) print gpioe
$1 = (stm32f30x::gpioc::RegisterBlock *) 0x48001000
</code></pre>
<p>But if we instead <code>print *gpioe</code>, we'll get a <em>full view</em> of the register block: the value of each

actually compile the program in release mode with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization">LTO</a> enabled, you'll see that it produces exactly
the same instructions that the &quot;unsafe&quot; version that used <code>write_volatile</code> and hexadecimal addresses

<p>The best part of all this is that I didn't have to write a single line of code to implement the
GPIOE API. All was automatically generated from a System View Description (SVD) file using the
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/svd2rust">svd2rust</a> tool. This SVD file is actually an XML file that microcontroller vendors provide and that
contains the register maps of their microcontrollers. The file contains the layout of register
blocks, the base addresses, the read/write permissions of each register, the layout of the
registers, whether a register has reserved bits and lots of other useful information.</p>

<p>In the last section, I gave you <em>initialized</em> (configured) peripherals (I initialized them in
<code>aux7::init</code>). That's why just writing to <code>BSRR</code> was enough to control the LEDs. But, peripherals
are not <em>initialized</em> right after the microcontroller boots.</p>
<p>In this section, you'll have more fun with registers. I won't do any initialization and you'll have
to initialize configure <code>GPIOE</code> pins as digital outputs pins so that you'll be able to drive LEDs
again.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#power" id="power">Power</a></h1>
<p>Turns out that, to save power, most peripherals start in a powered off state -- that's their state
right after the microcontroller boots.</p>
<p>The Reset and Clock Control (<code>RCC</code>) peripheral can be used to power on or off every other
peripheral.</p>
<p>You can find the list of registers in the <code>RCC</code> register block in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 9.4.14 - RCC register map - Page 166 - Reference Manual</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The registers that control the power status of other peripherals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AHBENR</code></li>
<li><code>APB1ENR</code></li>
<li><code>APB2ENR</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Each bit in these registers controls the power status of a single peripheral, including <code>GPIOE</code>.</p>
<p>Your task in this section is to power on the <code>GPIOE</code> peripheral. You'll have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out which of the three registers I mentioned before has the bit that controls the power
status.</li>
<li>Figure out what value that bit must be set to,<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, to power on the <code>GPIOE</code> peripheral.</li>
<li>Finally, you'll have to change the starter code to <em>modify</em> the right register to turn on the
<code>GPIOE</code> peripheral.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are successful, you'll see that the <code>gpioe.odr.write</code> statement will now be able to modify
the value of the <code>ODR</code> register.</p>
<p>Note that this won't be enough to actually turn on the LEDs.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#configuration" id="configuration">Configuration</a></h1>
<p>After turning on the GPIOE peripheral, it still needs to be configured. In this case, we
want the pins to be configured as digital <em>outputs</em> so they can drive the LEDs; by default, most
pins are configured as digital <em>inputs</em>.</p>
<p>You can find the list of registers in the <code>GPIOE</code> register block in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 11.4.12 - GPIO registers - Page 243 - Reference Manual</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The register we'll have to deal with is: <code>MODER</code>.</p>
<p>Your task for this section is to further update the starter code to configure the <em>right</em> <code>GPIOE</code>
pins as digital outputs. You'll have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out <em>which</em> pins you need to configure as digital outputs. (hint: check Section 6.4 LEDs of
the <em>User Manual</em> (page 18)).</li>
<li>Read the documentation to understand what the bits in the <code>MODER</code> register do.</li>
<li>Modify the <code>MODER</code> register to configure the pins as digital outputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If successful, you'll see the 8 LEDs turn on when you run the program.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#for-loop-delays" id="for-loop-delays"><code>for</code> loop delays</a></h1>
<p>The first challenge is to implement the <code>delay</code> function without using any peripheral and the
obvious solution is to implement it as a <code>for</code> loop delay:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[inline(never)]
fn delay(tim6: &amp;tim6::RegisterBlock, ms: u16) {
    for _ in 0..1_000 {}
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Of course, the above implementation is wrong because it always generates the same delay for any
value of <code>ms</code>.</p>
<p>In this section, you'll have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the <code>delay</code> function to generate delays proportional to its input <code>ms</code>.</li>
<li>Tweak the <code>delay</code> function to make the LED roulette spin at a rate of approximately 5 cycles in 4
seconds (800 milliseconds period).</li>
<li>The processor inside the microcontroller is clocked at 72 MHz and executes most instructions in one
&quot;tick&quot;, a cycle of its clock. How many (<code>for</code>) loops do  you <em>think</em> the <code>delay</code> function must do
to generate a delay of 1 second?</li>
<li>How many <code>for</code> loops does <code>delay(1000)</code> actually do?</li>
<li>What happens if compile your program in release mode and run it?</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#nop" id="nop">NOP</a></h1>
<p>If in the previous section you compiled the program in release mode and actually looked at the
disassembly, you probably noticed that the <code>delay</code> function is optimized away and never gets called
from within <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>LLVM decided that the function wasn't doing anything worthwhile and just removed it.</p>
<p>There is a way to prevent LLVM from optimizing the <code>for</code> loop delay: add a <em>volatile</em> assembly
instruction. Any instruction will do but NOP (No OPeration) is a particular good choice in this case
because it has no side effect.</p>
<p>Your <code>for</code> loop delay would become:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

<h1><a class="header" href="#one-shot-timer" id="one-shot-timer">One-shot timer</a></h1>
<p>I hope that, by now, I have convinced you that <code>for</code> loop delays are a poor way to implement delays.</p>
<p>Now, we'll implement delays using a <em>hardware timer</em>. The basic function of a (hardware) timer is
... to keep precise track of time. A timer is yet another peripheral that's available to the
microcontroller; thus it can be controlled using registers.</p>
<p>The microcontroller we are using has several (in fact, more than 10) timers of different kinds
(basic, general purpose, and advanced timers) available to it. Some timers have more <em>resolution</em>
(number of bits) than others and some can be used for more than just keeping track of time.</p>
<p>We'll be using one of the <em>basic</em> timers: <code>TIM6</code>. This is one of the simplest timers available in
our microcontroller. The documentation for basic timers is in the following section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 22 Timers - Page 670 - Reference Manual</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its registers are documented in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 22.4.9 TIM6/TIM7 register map - Page 682 - Reference Manual</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The registers we'll be using in this section are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SR</code>, the status register.</li>
<li><code>EGR</code>, the event generation register.</li>
<li><code>CNT</code>, the counter register.</li>
<li><code>PSC</code>, the prescaler register.</li>
<li><code>ARR</code>, the autoreload register.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be using the timer as a <em>one-shot</em> timer. It will sort of work like an alarm clock. We'll set
the timer to go off after some amount of time and then we'll wait until the timer goes off. The
documentation refers to this mode of operation as <em>one pulse mode</em>.</p>
<p>Here's a description of how a basic timer works when configured in one pulse mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>The counter is enabled by the user (<code>CR1.CEN = 1</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>CNT</code> register resets its value to zero and, on each tick, its value gets incremented by one.</li>
<li>Once the <code>CNT</code> register has reached the value of the <code>ARR</code> register, the counter will be disabled
by hardware (<code>CR1.CEN = 0</code>) and an <em>update event</em> will be raised (<code>SR.UIF = 1</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><code>TIM6</code> is driven by the APB1 clock, whose frequency doesn't have to necessarily match the processor
frequency. That is, the APB1 clock could be running faster or slower. The default, however, is that
both APB1 and the processor are clocked at 8 MHz.</p>
<p>The tick mentioned in the functional description of the one pulse mode is <em>not</em> the same as one
tick of the APB1 clock. The <code>CNT</code> register increases at a frequency of <code>apb1 / (psc + 1)</code>
times per second, where <code>apb1</code> is the frequency of the APB1 clock and <code>psc</code> is the value of the
prescaler register, <code>PSC</code>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#initialization" id="initialization">Initialization</a></h1>
<p>As with every other peripheral, we'll have to initialize this timer before we can use it. And just
as in the previous section, initialization is going to involve two steps: powering up the timer and
then configuring it.</p>
<p>Powering up the timer is easy: We just have to set <code>TIM6EN</code> bit to 1. This bit is in the <code>APB1ENR</code>
register of the <code>RCC</code> register block.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    // Power on the TIM6 timer
    rcc.apb1enr.modify(|_, w| w.tim6en().set_bit());
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The configuration part is slightly more elaborate.</p>
<p>First, we'll have to configure the timer to operate in one pulse mode.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    // OPM Select one pulse mode
    // CEN Keep the counter disabled for now
    tim6.cr1.write(|w| w.opm().set_bit().cen().clear_bit());
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Then, we'll like to have the <code>CNT</code> counter operate at a frequency of 1 KHz because our <code>delay</code>
function takes a number of milliseconds as arguments and 1 KHz produces a 1 millisecond period. For
that we'll have to configure the prescaler.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">

<p>I'm going to let you figure out the value of the prescaler, <code>psc</code>. Remember that the frequency of
the counter is <code>apb1 / (psc + 1)</code> and that <code>apb1</code> is 8 MHz.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#busy-waiting" id="busy-waiting">Busy waiting</a></h1>
<p>The timer should now be properly initialized. All that's left is to implement the <code>delay</code> function
using the timer.</p>
<p>First thing we have to do is set the autoreload register (<code>ARR</code>) to make the timer go off in <code>ms</code>
milliseconds. Because the counter operates at 1 KHz, the autoreload value will be the same as <code>ms</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    // Set the timer to go off in `ms` ticks
    // 1 tick = 1 ms
    tim6.arr.write(|w| w.arr().bits(ms));
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Next, we need to enable the counter. It will immediately start counting.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    // CEN: Enable the counter
    tim6.cr1.modify(|_, w| w.cen().set_bit());
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now we need to wait until the counter reaches the value of the autoreload register, <code>ms</code>, then we'll
know that <code>ms</code> milliseconds have passed. That condition is known as an <em>update event</em> and its
indicated by the <code>UIF</code> bit of the status register (<code>SR</code>).</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    // Wait until the alarm goes off (until the update event occurs)
    while !tim6.sr.read().uif().bit_is_set() {}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This pattern of just waiting until some condition is met, in this case that <code>UIF</code> becomes <code>1</code>, is
known as <em>busy waiting</em> and you'll see it a few more times in this text <code>:-)</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we must clear (set to <code>0</code>) this <code>UIF</code> bit. If we don't, next time we enter the <code>delay</code>
function we'll think the update event has already happened and skip over the busy waiting part.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

</span>    // Clear the update event flag
    tim6.sr.modify(|_, w| w.uif().clear_bit());
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now, put this all together and check if it works as expected.</p>

<img height="240" title="Standard serial port connector DE-9" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Serial_port.jpg/800px-Serial_port.jpg">
</p>
</a>
<p align="center">
<em>This is what we'll be using. I hope your computer has one!</em>
</p>
<p>Nah, don't worry. This connector, the DE-9, went out of fashion on PCs quite some time ago; it got
replaced by the Universal Serial Bus (USB). We won't be dealing with the DE-9 connector itself but
with the communication protocol that this cable is/was usually used for.</p>
<p>So what's this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_serial_communication"><em>serial communication</em></a>? It's an <em>asynchronous</em> communication protocol where two
devices exchange data <em>serially</em>, as in one bit at a time, using two data lines (plus a common
ground). The protocol is asynchronous in the sense that neither of the shared lines carries a clock
signal. Instead both parties must agree on how fast data will be sent along the wire <em>before</em> the
communication occurs. This protocol allows <em>duplex</em> communication as data can be sent from A to B
and from B to A simultaneously.</p>
<p>We'll be using this protocol to exchange data between the microcontroller and your computer. In
contrast to the ITM protocol we have used before, with the serial communication protocol you can
send data from your computer to the microcontroller.</p>
<p>The next practical question you probably want to ask is: How fast can we send data through this
protocol?</p>
<p>This protocol works with frames. Each frame has one <em>start</em> bit, 5 to 9 bits of payload (data) and 1
to 2 <em>stop bits</em>. The speed of the protocol is known as <em>baud rate</em> and it's quoted in bits per
second (bps). Common baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200 bps.</p>
<p>To actually answer the question: With a common configuration of 1 start bit, 8 bits of data, 1
stop bit and a baud rate of 115200 bps one can, in theory, send 11,520 frames per second. Since each
one frame carries a byte of data that results in a data rate of 11.52 KB/s. In practice, the data
rate will probably be lower because of processing times on the slower side of the communication (the
microcontroller).</p>
<p>Today's computers don't support the serial communication protocol. So you can't directly connect
your computer to the microcontroller. But that's where the serial module comes in. This module will
sit between the two and expose a serial interface to the microcontroller and an USB interface to
your computer. The microcontroller will see your computer as another serial device and your computer
will see the microcontroller as a virtual serial device.</p>
<p>Now, let's get familiar with the serial module and the serial communication tools that your OS
offers. Pick a route:</p>
<ul>

<p>With newer revisions, if you connect the discovery board to your computer you
should see a new TTY device appear in <code>/dev</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # Linux

<p>This is the USB &lt;-&gt; Serial device. On Linux, it's named <code>tty*</code> (usually
<code>ttyACM*</code> or <code>ttyUSB*</code>).</p>
<p>If you don't see the device appear then you probably have an older revision of
the board; check the next section, which contains instructions for older

<p>Connect the serial module to your computer and let's find out what name the OS assigned to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> On macs, the USB device will named like this: <code>/dev/cu.usbserial-*</code>. You won't
find it using <code>dmesg</code>, instead use <code>ls -l /dev | grep cu.usb</code> and adjust the following 
commands accordingly!</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ dmesg | grep -i tty
(..)
[  +0.000155] usb 3-2: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
</code></pre>
<p>But what's this <code>ttyUSB0</code> thing? It's a file of course! Everything is a file in *nix:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0

see <a href="10-serial-communication/../03-setup/linux.html#udev-rules">udev rules</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can send out data by simply writing to this file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ echo 'Hello, world!' &gt; /dev/ttyUSB0
</code></pre>
<p>You should see the TX (red) LED on the serial module blink, just once and very fast!</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#all-revisions-minicom" id="all-revisions-minicom">All revisions: minicom</a></h2>
<p>Dealing with serial devices using <code>echo</code> is far from ergonomic. So, we'll use the program <code>minicom</code>
to interact with the serial device using the keyboard.</p>
<p>We must configure <code>minicom</code> before we use it. There are quite a few ways to do that but we'll use a
<code>.minirc.dfl</code> file in the home directory. Create a file in <code>~/.minirc.dfl</code> with the following
contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cat ~/.minirc.dfl
pu baudrate 115200
pu bits 8
pu parity N
pu stopbits 1
pu rtscts No
pu xonxoff No
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Make sure this file ends in a newline! Otherwise, <code>minicom</code> will fail to read it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That file should be straightforward to read (except for the last two lines), but nonetheless let's
go over it line by line:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pu baudrate 115200</code>. Sets baud rate to 115200 bps.</li>
<li><code>pu bits 8</code>. 8 bits per frame.</li>
<li><code>pu parity N</code>. No parity check.</li>
<li><code>pu stopbits 1</code>. 1 stop bit.</li>
<li><code>pu rtscts No</code>. No hardware control flow.</li>
<li><code>pu xonxoff No</code>. No software control flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that's in place, we can launch <code>minicom</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # NOTE you may need to use a different device here
$ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200
</code></pre>
<p>This tells <code>minicom</code> to open the serial device at <code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> and set its
baud rate to 115200. A text-based user interface (TUI) will pop out.</p>
<p align="center">
<img title="minicom" src="10-serial-communication/../assets/minicom.png">
</p>
<p>You can now send data using the keyboard! Go ahead and type something. Note that
the TUI will <em>not</em> echo back what you type but, if you are using an external
module, you <em>may</em> see some LED on the module blink with each keystroke.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#minicom-commands" id="minicom-commands"><code>minicom</code> commands</a></h2>

<p>Start by unplugging your discovery board.</p>
<p>Before plugging the discovery board or the serial module, run the following command on
the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ mode
</code></pre>
<p>It will print a list of devices that are connected to your computer. The ones that start with <code>COM</code> in
their names are serial devices. This is the kind of device we'll be working with. Take note of all
the <code>COM</code> <em>ports</em> <code>mode</code> outputs <em>before</em> plugging the serial module.</p>
<p>Now, plug the discovery board and run the <code>mode</code> command again. If you see a new
<code>COM</code> port appear on the list then you have a newer revision of the discovery
and that's the COM port assigned to the serial functionality on the discovery.
You can skip the next paragraph.</p>
<p>If you didn't get a new COM port then you probably have an older revision of the
discovery. Now plug the serial module; you should see new COM port appear;
that's the COM port of the serial module.</p>
<p>Now launch <code>putty</code>. A GUI will pop out.</p>
<p align="center">
<img title="PuTTY settings" src="10-serial-communication/../assets/putty-settings.png">
</p>
<p>On the starter screen, which should have the &quot;Session&quot; category open, pick &quot;Serial&quot; as the
&quot;Connection type&quot;. On the &quot;Serial line&quot; field enter the <code>COM</code> device you got on the previous step,
for example <code>COM3</code>.</p>
<p>Next, pick the &quot;Connection/Serial&quot; category from the menu on the left. On this new view, make sure
that the serial port is configured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Speed (baud)&quot;: 115200</li>
<li>&quot;Data bits&quot;: 8</li>
<li>&quot;Stop bits&quot;: 1</li>
<li>&quot;Parity&quot;: None</li>
<li>&quot;Flow control&quot;: None</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, click the Open button. A console will show up now:</p>
<p align="center">
<img title="PuTTY console" src="10-serial-communication/../assets/putty-console.png">
</p>
<p>If you type on this console, the TX (red) LED on the Serial module should blink. Each key stroke
should make the LED blink once. Note that the console won't echo back what you type so the screen
will remain blank.</p>

<hr />
<p>Now that you are familiar with sending and receiving data over serial port using minicom/PuTTY,
let's make your microcontroller and your computer talk!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#usart" id="usart">USART</a></h1>
<p>The microcontroller has a peripheral called USART, which stands for Universal
Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. This peripheral can be configured to work with
several communication protocols like the serial communication protocol.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, we'll use serial communication to exchange information between the
microcontroller and your computer. But before we do that we have to wire up everything.</p>
<p>I mentioned before that this protocol involves two data lines: TX and RX. TX stands for transmitter
and RX stands for receiver. Transmitter and receiver are relative terms though; which line is the
transmitter and which line is the receiver depends from which side of the communication you are
looking at the lines.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#newer-board-revisions" id="newer-board-revisions">Newer board revisions</a></h3>
<p>If you have a newer revision of the board and are using the on-board USB &lt;-&gt;
Serial functionality then the <code>auxiliary</code> crate will set pin <code>PC4</code> as the TX
line and pin <code>PC5</code> as the RX line.</p>
<p>Everything is already wired on the board so you don't need to wire anything yourself.
You can move on to the <a href="11-usart/send-a-single-byte.html">next section</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#older-board-revisions--external-serial-module" id="older-board-revisions--external-serial-module">Older board revisions / external serial module</a></h3>
<p>If you are using an external USB &lt;-&gt; Serial module then you will <strong>need</strong> to
enable the <code>adapter</code> feature of the <code>aux11</code> crate dependency in <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies.aux11]
path = &quot;auxiliary&quot;
# enable this if you are going to use an external serial adapter
features = [&quot;adapter&quot;] # &lt;- uncomment this
</code></pre>
<p>We'll be using the pin <code>PA9</code> as the microcontroller's TX line and <code>PA10</code> as its RX line. In other
words, the pin <code>PA9</code> outputs data onto its wire whereas the pin <code>PA10</code> listens for data on its
wire.</p>
<p>We could have used a different pair of pins as the TX and RX pins. There's a table in page 44 of the
<a href="http://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f303vc.pdf">Data Sheet</a> that list all the other possible pins we could have used.</p>
<p>The serial module also has TX and RX pins. We'll have to <em>cross</em> these pins: that is connect the
microcontroller's TX pin to the serial module's RX pin and the micro's RX pin to the serial module's
TX pin. The wiring diagram below shows all the necessary connections.</p>
<p align="center">
<img height=640 title="F3 <-> Serial connection" src="../assets/f3-serial.png">
</p>
<p>These are the recommended steps to connect the microcontroller and the serial module:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close OpenOCD and <code>itmdump</code></li>
<li>Disconnect the USB cables from the F3 and the serial module.</li>
<li>Connect one of F3 GND pins to the GND pin of the serial module using a female to male (F/M) wire.
Preferably, a black one.</li>
<li>Connect the PA9 pin on the back of the F3 to the RXI pin of the serial module using a F/M wire.</li>
<li>Connect the PA10 pin on the back of the F3 to the TXO pin of the serial module using a F/M wire.</li>
<li>Now connect the USB cable to the F3.</li>
<li>Finally connect the USB cable to the Serial module.</li>
<li>Re-launch OpenOCD and <code>itmdump</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Everything's wired up! Let's proceed to send data back and forth.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#send-a-single-byte" id="send-a-single-byte">Send a single byte</a></h1>
<p>Our first task will be to send a single byte from the microcontroller to the computer over the serial
connection.</p>
<p>This time, I'm going to provide you with an already initialized USART peripheral. You'll only have
to work with the registers that are in charge of sending and receiving data.</p>
<p>Go into the <code>11-usart</code> directory and let's run the starter code therein. Make sure that you have
minicom/PuTTY open.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#![deny(unsafe_code)]

    loop {}
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program writes to the <code>TDR</code> register. This causes the <code>USART</code> peripheral to send one byte of
information through the serial interface.</p>
<p>On the receiving end, your computer, you should see show the character <code>X</code> appear on minicom/PuTTY's
terminal.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#send-a-string" id="send-a-string">Send a string</a></h1>
<p>The next task will be to send a whole string from the microcontroller to your computer.</p>

your computer.</p>
<p>It's your turn to write the program.</p>
<p>Execute your program inside the debugger, statement by statement. What do you see?</p>
<p>Then execute the program again but in <em>one go</em> using the <code>continue</code> command. What happens this time?</p>
<p>Finally, build the program in <em>release</em> mode and, again, run it one go. What happens this time?</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#overruns" id="overruns">Overruns</a></h1>

<p>And if you compiled in release mode, you probably only got something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # minicom's terminal
(..)
T
</code></pre>
<p>What went wrong?</p>
<p>You see, sending bytes over the wire takes a relatively large amount of time. I already did the math
so let me quote myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a common configuration of 1 start bit, 8 bits of data, 1 stop bit and a baud rate of 115200
bps one can, in theory, send 11,520 frames per second. Since each one frame carries a byte of data
that results in a data rate of 11.52 KB/s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our pangram has a length of 45 bytes. That means it's going to take, at least, 3,900 microseconds
(<code>45 bytes / (11,520 bytes/s) = 3,906 us</code>) to send the string. The processor is working at 8 MHz,
where executing an instruction takes 125 nanoseconds, so it's likely going to be done with the <code>for</code>
loop in less than 3,900 microseconds.</p>
<p>We can actually time how long it takes to execute the <code>for</code> loop. <code>aux11::init()</code> returns a
<code>MonoTimer</code> (monotonic timer) value that exposes an <code>Instant</code> API that's similar to the one in
<code>std::time</code>.</p>

<p>This is less than 3,900 microseconds but it's not that far off and that's why only a few bytes of
information are lost.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the processor is trying to send bytes at a faster rate than what the hardware can
actually handle and this results in data loss. This condition is known as buffer <em>overrun</em>.</p>
<p>How do we avoid this? The status register (<code>ISR</code>) has a flag, <code>TXE</code>, that indicates if it's &quot;safe&quot;
to write to the <code>TDR</code> register without incurring in data loss.</p>
<p>Let's use that to slowdown the processor.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#uprintln" id="uprintln"><code>uprintln!</code></a></h1>
<p>For the next exercise, we'll implement the <code>uprint!</code> family of macros. Your goal is to make this
line of code work:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    uprintln!(serial, &quot;The answer is {}&quot;, 40 + 2);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Which must send the string <code>&quot;The answer is 42&quot;</code> through the serial interface.</p>
<p>How do we go about that? It's informative to look into the <code>std</code> implementation of <code>println!</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">

}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Looks simple so far. We need the built-in <code>format_args!</code> macro (it's implemented in the compiler so we
can't see what it actually does). We'll have to use that macro in the exact same way. What does this
<code>_print</code> function do?</p>

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>That <em>looks</em> complicated but the only part we are interested in is: <code>w.write_fmt(args)</code> and
<code>stdout().write_fmt(args)</code>. What <code>print!</code> ultimately does is call the <code>fmt::Write::write_fmt</code> method
with the output of <code>format_args!</code> as its argument.</p>
<p>Luckily we don't have to implement the <code>fmt::Write::write_fmt</code> method either because it's a default
method. We only have to implement the <code>fmt::Write::write_str</code> method.</p>
<p>Let's do that.</p>
<p>This is what the macro side of the equation looks like. What's left to be done by you is provide the
implementation of the <code>write_str</code> method.</p>
<p>Above we saw that <code>Write</code> is in <code>std::fmt</code>. We don't have access to <code>std</code> but <code>Write</code> is also
available in <code>core::fmt</code>.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#bluetooth-setup" id="bluetooth-setup">Bluetooth setup</a></h1>
<p>It's time to get rid of some wires. Serial communication can not only be emulated on top of the USB
protocol; it can also be emulated on top of the Bluetooth protocol. This serial over Bluetooth
protocol is known as RFCOMM.</p>
<p>Before we use the Bluetooth module with the microcontroller, let's first interact with it using
minicom/PuTTY.</p>
<p>The first thing we'll need to do is: turn on the Bluetooth module. We'll have to share some of the
F3 power to it using the following connection:</p>
<p align="center">
<img height=640 title="F3 <-> Bluetooth connection (power only)" src="../assets/f3-bluetooth-power-only.png">
</p>
<p>The recommend steps to wire this up are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close OpenOCD and <code>itmdump</code></li>
<li>Disconnect the USB cables from the F3 and the serial module.</li>
<li>Connect F3's GND pin to the Bluetooth's GND pin using a female to female (F/F) wire. Preferably, a
black one.</li>
<li>Connect F3's 5V pin to the Bluetooth's VCC pin using a F/F wire. Preferably, a red one.</li>
<li>Then, connect the USB cable back to the F3.</li>
<li>Re-launch OpenOCD and <code>itmdump</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Two LEDs, a blue one and a red one, on the Bluetooth module should start blinking right after you
power on the F3 board.</p>
<p>Next thing to do is pair your computer and the Bluetooth module. AFAIK, Windows and mac users can
simply use their OS default Bluetooth manager to do the pairing. The Bluetooth module default pin
is 1234.</p>
<p>Linux users will have to follow (some of) <a href="12-bluetooth-setup/linux.html">these instructions</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#linux-1" id="linux-1">Linux</a></h1>
<p>If you have a graphical Bluetooth manager, you can use that to pair your computer to the Bluetooth
module and skip most of these steps. You'll probably still have to <a href="12-bluetooth-setup/linux.html#rfcomm-device">this step</a> though.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#power-up" id="power-up">Power up</a></h2>
<p>First, your computer's Bluetooth transceiver may be OFF. Check its status with <code>hciconfig</code> and turn it
ON if necessary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ hciconfig

        TX bytes:1072 acl:0 sco:0 commands:66 errors:0
</code></pre>
<p>Then you need to launch the BlueZ (Bluetooth) daemon:</p>
<ul>
<li>On systemd based Linux distributions, use:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ sudo systemctl start bluetooth
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>On Ubuntu (or upstart based Linux distributions), use:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth start
</code></pre>
<p>You may also need to unblock your Bluetooth, depending on what <code>rfkill list</code> says:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rfkill list
9: hci0: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: yes # &lt;--
        Hard blocked: no

</code></pre>
<p>Because we used <code>0</code> as an argument to <code>bind</code>, <code>/dev/rfcomm0</code> will be the device file assigned to our
Bluetooth module.</p>
<p>You can release (destroy) the device file at any time with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # Don't actually run this command right now!
$ sudo rfcomm release 0
</code></pre>
<h1><a class="header" href="#loopback-again" id="loopback-again">Loopback, again</a></h1>
<p>After pairing your computer to the Bluetooth module, your OS should have created a device file / COM
port for you. On Linux, it should be <code>/dev/rfcomm*</code>; on mac, it should be <code>/dev/cu.*</code>; and on
Windows, it should be a new COM port.</p>
<p>We can now test the Bluetooth module with minicom/PuTTY. Because this module doesn't have LED
indicators for the transmission and reception events like the serial module did, we'll test the
module using a loopback connection:</p>
<p align="center">
<img height=640 title="F3 <-> Bluetooth connection (loopback)" src="../assets/f3-bluetooth-loopback.png">
</p>
<p>Just connect the module's TXD pin to its RXD pin using a F/F wire.</p>
<p>Now, connect to the device using <code>minicom</code>/<code>PuTTY</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ minicom -D /dev/rfcomm0
</code></pre>
<p>Upon connecting, the blinking pattern of the Bluetooth module should change to: long pause then
blink twice quickly.</p>
<p>Typing inside minicom/PuTTY terminal should echo back what you type.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#at-commands" id="at-commands">AT commands</a></h2>
<p>The Bluetooth module and the F3 need to be configured to communicate at the same baud rate. The tutorial code initializes the UART1 serial device to a baud rate of 115200. The HC-05 Bluetooth module is configured at a baud rate of 9600 by default.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth module supports an AT mode that allows you to examine and change its configuration and settings. To utilize the AT mode, connect the Bluetooth module to the F3 and FTDI as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<p align="center">
<img height=640 title="Bluetooth <-> Serial connection" src="../assets/bluetooth-serial.png">
</p>
<p>Recommended steps to enter AT mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect the F3 and FTDI from your computer.</li>
<li>Connect F3's GND pin to the Bluetooth's GND pin using a Female/Female (F/F) wire
(preferably, a black one).</li>
<li>Connect F3's 5V pin to the Bluetooth's VCC pin using a F/F wire (preferably, a
red one).</li>
<li>Connect the FTDI RXI pin to the Bluetooth's TXD pin using a Female/Male (F/M) wire.</li>
<li>Connect the FTDI TXO pin to the Bluetooth's RXD pin using a Female/Male (F/M) wire.</li>
<li>Now connect the FTDI to your computer via USB cable.</li>
<li>Next connect the F3 to your computer via USB cable while simultaneously pressing and holding the button on the Bluetooth module (kinda tricky).</li>
<li>Now, release the button and the Bluetooth module will enter AT mode. You can confirm this by observing that the red LED on the Bluetooth module is blinking in a slow pattern (approx 1-2 seconds on/off).</li>
</ul>
<p>The AT mode always operates at a baud rate of 38400, so configure your terminal program for that baud rate and connect to the FTDI device.</p>
<p>When your serial connection is established, you may get a bunch of <code>ERROR: (0)</code> repeatedly being displayed. If this happens, just hit ENTER to stop the errors.</p>

<p>However, it's simplicity is also a downside. More elaborated data exchanges, like reading a digital
sensor, would require the sensor vendor to come up with another protocol on top of it.</p>
<p>(Un)Luckily for us, there are <em>plenty</em> of other communication protocols in the embedded space. Some
of them are widely used in digital sensors.</p>
<p>The F3 board we are using has three motion sensors in it: an accelerometer, a magnetometer and
gyroscope. The accelerometer and magnetometer are packaged in a single component and can be accessed
via an I2C bus.</p>
<p>I2C stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit and is a <em>synchronous</em> <em>serial</em> communication protocol. It
uses two lines to exchange data: a data line (SDA) and a clock line (SCL). Because a clock line is
used to synchronize the communication, this is a <em>synchronous</em> protocol.</p>
<p align="center">
<img class="white_bg" height=180 title="I2C bus" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/I2C.svg">
</p>
<p>This protocol uses a <em>master</em> <em>slave</em> model where the master is the device that <em>starts</em> and
drives the communication with a slave device. Several devices, both masters and slaves, can be
connected to the same bus at the same time. A master device can communicate with a specific slave
device by first broadcasting its <em>address</em> to the bus. This address can be 7 bits or 10 bits long.
Once a master has <em>started</em> a communication with a slave, no other device can make use of the bus
until the master <em>stops</em> the communication.</p>
<p>The clock line determines how fast data can be exchanged and it usually operates at a frequency of
100 KHz (standard mode) or 400 KHz (fast mode).</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#general-protocol" id="general-protocol">General protocol</a></h1>
<p>The I2C protocol is more elaborated than the serial communication protocol because it has to support
communication between several devices. Let's see how it works using examples:</p>

<p>Two of the sensors in the F3, the magnetometer and the accelerometer, are packaged in a single
component: the LSM303DLHC integrated circuit. These two sensors can be accessed via an I2C bus. Each
sensor behaves like an I2C slave and has a <em>different</em> address.</p>
<p>Each sensor has its own memory where it stores the results of sensing its environment. Our
interaction with these sensors will mainly involve reading their memory.</p>
<p>The memory of these sensors is modeled as byte addressable registers. These sensors can be
configured too; that's done by writing to their registers. So, in a sense, these sensors are very
similar to the peripherals <em>inside</em> the microcontroller. The difference is that their registers are
not mapped into the microcontrollers' memory. Instead, their registers have to be accessed via the
I2C bus.</p>
<p>The main source of information about the LSM303DLHC is its <a href="http://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/lsm303dlhc.pdf">Data Sheet</a>. Read through it to see how
one can read the sensors' registers. That part is in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 5.1.1 I2C Operation - Page 20 - LSM303DLHC Data Sheet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other part of the documentation relevant to this book is the description of the registers. That
part is in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 7 Register description - Page 25 - LSM303DLHC Data Sheet</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a class="header" href="#read-a-single-register" id="read-a-single-register">Read a single register</a></h1>
<p>Let's put all that theory into practice!</p>
<p>Just like with the USART peripheral, I've taken care of initializing everything before you reach
<code>main</code> so you'll only have to deal with the following registers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CR2</code>. Control register 2.</li>
<li><code>ISR</code>. Interrupt and status register.</li>
<li><code>TXDR</code>. Transmit data register.</li>
<li><code>RXDR</code>. Receive data register.</li>
</ul>
<p>These registers are documented in the following section of the Reference Manual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 28.7 I2C registers - Page 868 - Reference Manual</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll be using the <code>I2C1</code> peripheral in conjunction with pins <code>PB6</code> (<code>SCL</code>) and <code>PB7</code> (<code>SDA</code>).</p>
<p>You won't have to wire anything this time because the sensor is on the board and it's already
connected to the microcontroller. However, I would recommend that you disconnect the serial /
Bluetooth module from the F3 to make it easier to manipulate. Later on, we'll be moving the board
around quite a bit.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a program that reads the contents of the magnetometer's <code>IRA_REG_M</code> register.
This register is read only and always contains the value <code>0b01001000</code>.</p>
<p>The microcontroller will be taking the role of the I2C master and the magnetometer inside the
LSM303DLHC will be the I2C slave.</p>

<p>This is the Earth's magnetic field decomposed alongside the XYZ axis of the magnetometer.</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll learn how to make sense of these numbers.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#led-compass" id="led-compass">LED compass</a></h1>
<p>In this section, we'll implement a compass using the LEDs on the F3. Like proper compasses, our LED
compass must point north somehow. It will do that by turning on one of its eight LEDs; the on LED
should point towards north.</p>
<p>Magnetic fields have both a magnitude, measured in Gauss or Teslas, and a <em>direction</em>. The
magnetometer on the F3 measures both the magnitude and the direction of an external magnetic field
but it reports back the <em>decomposition</em> of said field along <em>its axes</em>.</p>
<p>See below, the magnetometer has three axes associated to it.</p>
<p align="center">
<img height=480 title="Magnetometer axes" src="15-led-compass/../assets/f3-lsm303dlhc.png">
</p>
<p>Only the X and Y axes are shown above. The Z axis is pointing &quot;out&quot; of your screen.</p>
<p>Let's get familiar with the readings of the magnetometer by running the following starter code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#![deny(unsafe_code)]
#![no_main]

#[allow(unused_imports)]
use aux15::{entry, iprint, iprintln, prelude::*};

    loop {
        iprintln!(&amp;mut itm.stim[0], &quot;{:?}&quot;, lsm303dlhc.mag().unwrap());
        delay.delay_ms(1_000_u16);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This <code>lsm303dlhc</code> module provides high level API over the LSM303DLHC. Under the hood it does the
same I2C routine that you implemented in the last section but it reports the X, Y and Z values in a
<code>I16x3</code> struct instead of a tuple.</p>
<p>Locate where north is at your current location. Then rotate the board such that it's aligned
&quot;towards north&quot;: the North LED (LD3) should be pointing towards north.</p>
<p>Now run the starter code and observe the output. What X, Y and Z values do you see?</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ # itmdump terminal
(..)
I16x3 { x: 45, y: 194, z: -3 }
I16x3 { x: 46, y: 195, z: -8 }
I16x3 { x: 47, y: 197, z: -2 }
</code></pre>
<p>Now rotate the board 90 degrees while keeping it parallel to the ground. What X, Y and Z values do
you see this time? Then rotate it 90 degrees again. What values do you see?</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#take-1" id="take-1">Take 1</a></h1>
<p>What's the simplest way in which we can implement the LED compass? Even if it's not perfect.</p>
<p>For starters, we'd only care about the X and Y components of the magnetic field because when you
look at a compass you always hold it in horizontal position thus the compass is in the XY plane.</p>
<p>For example, what LED would you turn on in the following case. EMF stands for Earth's Magnetic Field
and green arrow has the direction of the EMF (it points north).</p>
<p align="center">
<img title="Quadrant I" src="15-led-compass/../assets/quadrant-i.png">
</p
<p>The <code>Southeast</code> LED, right?</p>
<p>What <em>signs</em> do the X and Y components of the magnetic field have in that scenario? Both are
positive.</p>
<p>If we only looked at the signs of the X and Y components we could determine to which quadrant the
magnetic field belongs to.</p>
<p align="center">
<img class="white_bg" title="Quadrants" src="15-led-compass/../assets/quadrants.png">
</p>
<p>In the previous example, the magnetic field was in the first quadrant (x and y were positive) and it
made sense to turn on the <code>SouthEast</code> LED. Similarly, we could turn a different LED if the magnetic
field was in a different quadrant.</p>
<p>Let's try that logic. Here's the starter code:</p>

<p>There's a <code>Direction</code> enum in the <code>led</code> module that has 8 variants named after the cardinal points:
<code>North</code>, <code>East</code>, <code>Southwest</code>, etc. Each of these variants represent one of the 8 LEDs in the
compass. The <code>Leds</code> value can be indexed using the <code>Direction</code> <code>enum</code>; the result of indexing is the

<h1><a class="header" href="#magnitude" id="magnitude">Magnitude</a></h1>
<p>We have been working with the direction of the magnetic field but what's its real magnitude? The
number that the <code>magnetic_field</code> function reports are unit-less. How can we convert those values to
Gauss?</p>
<p>The documentation will answer that question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 2.1 Sensor characteristics - Page 10 - LSM303DLHC Data Sheet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The table in that page shows a <em>magnetic gain setting</em> that has different values according to the
values of the GN bits. By default, those GN bits are set to <code>001</code>. That means that magnetic gain of
the X and Y axes is <code>1100 LSB / Gauss</code> and the magnetic gain of the Z axis is <code>980 LSB / Gauss</code>. LSB
stands for Least Significant Bits and the <code>1100 LSB / Gauss</code> number indicates that a reading of
<code>1100</code> is equivalent to <code>1 Gauss</code>, a reading of <code>2200</code> is equivalent to 2 Gauss and so on.</p>
<p>So, what we need to do is divide the X, Y and Z values that the sensor outputs by its corresponding
<em>gain</em>. Then, we'll have the X, Y and Z components of the magnetic field in Gauss.</p>
<p>With some extra math we can retrieve the magnitude of the magnetic field from its X, Y and Z
components:</p>

<p>This program will report the magnitude (strength) of the magnetic field in milligauss (<code>mG</code>). The
magnitude of the Earth's magnetic field is in the range of <code>250 mG</code> to <code>650 mG</code> (the magnitude
varies depending on your geographical location) so you should see a value in that range or close to
that range -- I see a magnitude of around 210 mG.</p>
<p>Some questions:</p>
<p>Without moving the board, what value do you see? Do you always see the same value?</p>
<p>If you rotate the board, does the magnitude change? Should it change?</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#calibration" id="calibration">Calibration</a></h1>
<p>If we rotate the board, the direction of the Earth's magnetic field with respect to the magnetometer
should change but its magnitude should not! Yet, the magnetometer indicates that the magnitude of
the magnetic field changes as the board rotates.</p>
<p>Why's that the case? Turns out the magnetometer needs to be calibrated to return the correct answer.</p>
<p>The calibration involves quite a bit of math (matrices) so we won't cover it here but this
<a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN4246.pdf">Application Note</a> describes the procedure if you are interested. Instead, what we'll do in this
section is <em>visualize</em> how off we are.</p>
<p>Let's try this experiment: Let's record the readings of the magnetometer while we slowly rotate the
board in different directions. We'll use the <code>iprintln</code> macro to format the readings as Tab
Separated Values (TSV).</p>

<p>If you rotated the board on a flat horizontal surface, the Z component of the magnetic field should
have remained relatively constant and this plot should have been a circumference (not a ellipse)
centered at the origin. If you rotated the board in random directions, which was the case of plot
above, then you should have gotten a circle made of a bunch of points centered at the origin.

<p>In this section we'll be playing with the accelerometer that's in the board.</p>
<p>What are we building this time? A punch-o-meter! We'll be measuring the power of your jabs. Well,
actually the maximum acceleration that you can reach because acceleration is what accelerometers
measure. Strength and acceleration are proportional though so it's a good approximation.</p>
<p>The accelerometer is also built inside the LSM303DLHC package. And just like the magnetometer, it
can also be accessed using the I2C bus. It also has the same coordinate system as the magnetometer.
Here's the coordinate system again:</p>

<p>The starter code prints the X, Y and Z components of the acceleration measured by the accelerometer.
The values have already been &quot;scaled&quot; and have units of <code>g</code>s. Where <code>1 g</code> is equal to the

<p>Which is weird because the board is not moving yet its acceleration is non-zero. What's going on?
This must be related to the gravity, right? Because the acceleration of gravity is <code>1 g</code>. But the
gravity pulls objects downwards so the acceleration along the Z axis should be negative not positive
...</p>
<p>Did the program get the Z axis backwards? Nope, you can test rotating the board to align the gravity
to the X or Y axis but the acceleration measured by the accelerometer is always pointing up.</p>
<p>What happens here is that the accelerometer is measuring the <em>proper acceleration</em> of the board not
the acceleration <em>you</em> are observing. This proper acceleration is the acceleration of the board as
seen from a observer that's in free fall. An observer that's in free fall is moving toward the
center of the the Earth with an acceleration of <code>1g</code>; from its point of view the board is actually
moving upwards (away from the center of the Earth) with an acceleration of <code>1g</code>. And that's why the
proper acceleration is pointing up. This also means that if the board was in free fall, the
accelerometer would report a proper acceleration of zero. Please, don't try that at home.</p>
<p>Yes, physics is hard. Let's move on.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-challenge-1" id="the-challenge-1">The challenge</a></h1>
<p>To keep things simple, we'll measure the acceleration only in the X axis while the board remains
horizontal. That way we won't have to deal with subtracting that <em>fictitious</em> <code>1g</code> we observed
before which would be hard because that <code>1g</code> could have X Y Z components depending on how the board
is oriented.</p>
<p>Here's what the punch-o-meter must do:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, the app is not &quot;observing&quot; the acceleration of the board.</li>
<li>When a significant X acceleration is detected (i.e. the acceleration goes above some threshold),
the app should start a new measurement.</li>
<li>During that measurement interval, the app should keep track of the maximum acceleration observed</li>
<li>After the measurement interval ends, the app must report the maximum acceleration observed. You
can report the value using the <code>iprintln</code> macro.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give it a try and let me know how hard you can punch <code>;-)</code>.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#topics-about-embedded-software" id="topics-about-embedded-software">Topics about embedded software</a></h2>
<p>These topics discuss strategies for writing embedded software. Although many
problems can be solved in different ways, these sections talk about some
strategies, and when they make sense (or don't make sense) to use.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#multitasking" id="multitasking">Multitasking</a></h3>
<p>All our programs executed a single task. How could we achieve multitasking in a
system with no OS, and thus no threads. There are two main approaches to
multitasking: preemptive multitasking and cooperative multitasking.</p>
<p>In preemptive multitasking a task that's currently being executed can, at any point in time, be
<em>preempted</em> (interrupted) by another task. On preemption, the first task will be suspended and the
processor will instead execute the second task. At some point the first task will be resumed.
Microcontrollers provide hardware support for preemption in the form of <em>interrupts</em>.</p>
<p>In cooperative multitasking a task that's being executed will run until it reaches a <em>suspension
point</em>. When the processor reaches that suspension point it will stop executing the current task and
instead go and execute a different task. At some point the first task will be resumed. The main
difference between these two approaches to multitasking is that in cooperative multitasking <em>yields</em>
execution control at <em>known</em> suspension points instead of being forcefully preempted at any point of
its execution.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#sleeping" id="sleeping">Sleeping</a></h3>
<p>All our programs have been continuously polling peripherals to see if there's
anything that needs to be done. However, some times there's nothing to be done!
At those times, the microcontroller should &quot;sleep&quot;.</p>
<p>When the processor sleeps, it stops executing instructions and this saves power.
It's almost always a good idea to save power so your microcontroller should be
sleeping as much as possible. But, how does it know when it has to wake up to
perform some action? &quot;Interrupts&quot; are one of the events that wake up the
microcontroller but there are others and the <code>wfi</code> and <code>wfe</code> are the
instructions that make the processor &quot;sleep&quot;.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#topics-related-to-microcontroller-capabilities" id="topics-related-to-microcontroller-capabilities">Topics related to microcontroller capabilities</a></h2>
<p>Microcontrollers (like our STM32F3) have many different capabilities. However, many share similar
capabilities that can be used to solve all sorts of different problems.</p>
<p>These topics discuss some of those capabilities, and how they can be used effectively
in embedded development.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#direct-memory-access-dma" id="direct-memory-access-dma">Direct Memory Access (DMA).</a></h3>
<p>This peripheral is a kind of <em>asynchronous</em> <code>memcpy</code>. So far our programs have
been pumping data, byte by byte, into peripherals like UART and I2C. This DMA
peripheral can be used to perform bulk transfers of data. Either from RAM to
RAM, from a peripheral, like a UART, to RAM or from RAM to a peripheral. You can
schedule a DMA transfer, like read 256 bytes from USART1 into this buffer, leave
it running in the background and then poll some register to see if it has
completed so you can do other stuff while the transfer is ongoing.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#interrupts" id="interrupts">Interrupts</a></h3>
<p>In order to interact with the real world, it is often necessary for the
microcontroller to respond <em>immediately</em> when some kind of event occurs.</p>
<p>Microcontrollers have the ability to be interrupted, meaning when a certain event
occurs, it will stop whatever it is doing at the moment, to instead respond to that
event. This can be very useful when we want to stop a motor when a button is pressed,
or measure a sensor when a timer finishes counting down.</p>
<p>Although these interrupts can be very useful, they can also be a bit difficult
to work with properly. We want to make sure that we respond to events quickly,
but also allow other work to continue as well.</p>
<p>In Rust, we model interrupts similar to the concept of threading on desktop Rust
programs. This means we also must think about the Rust concepts of <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>
when sharing data between our main application, and code that executes as part of
handling an interrupt event.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#pulse-width-modulation-pwm" id="pulse-width-modulation-pwm">Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</a></h3>
<p>In a nutshell, PWM is turning on something and then turning it off periodically
while keeping some proportion (&quot;duty cycle&quot;) between the &quot;on time&quot; and the &quot;off
time&quot;. When used on a LED with a sufficiently high frequency, this can be used
to dim the LED. A low duty cycle, say 10% on time and 90% off time, will make
the LED very dim wheres a high duty cycle, say 90% on time and 10% off time,
will make the LED much brighter (almost as if it were fully powered).</p>
<p>In general, PWM can be used to control how much <em>power</em> is given to some
electric device. With proper (power) electronics between a microcontroller and
an electrical motor, PWM can be used to control how much power is given to the
motor thus it can be used to control its torque and speed. Then you can add an
angular position sensor and you got yourself a closed loop controller that can
control the position of the motor at different loads.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#digital-inputs" id="digital-inputs">Digital inputs</a></h3>
<p>We have used the microcontroller pins as digital outputs, to drive LEDs. But
these pins can also be configured as digital inputs. As digital inputs, these
pins can read the binary state of switches (on/off) or buttons (pressed/not
pressed).</p>
<p>(<em>spoilers</em> reading the binary state of switches / buttons is not as
straightforward as it sounds ;-)</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#analog-to-digital-converters-adc" id="analog-to-digital-converters-adc">Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC)</a></h3>
<p>There are a lots of digital sensors out there. You can use a protocol like I2C
and SPI to read them. But analog sensors also exist! These sensors just output a
voltage level that's proportional to the magnitude they are sensing.</p>
<p>The ADC peripheral can be use to convert that &quot;analog&quot; voltage level, say <code>1.25</code>
Volts,into a &quot;digital&quot; number, say in the <code>[0, 65535]</code> range, that the processor
can use in its calculations.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#digital-to-analog-converters-dac" id="digital-to-analog-converters-dac">Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC)</a></h3>
<p>As you might expect a DAC is exactly the opposite of ADC. You can write some
digital value into a register to produce a voltage in the <code>[0, 3.3V]</code> range
(assuming a <code>3.3V</code> power supply) on some &quot;analog&quot; pin. When this analog pin is
connected to some appropriate electronics and the register is written to at some
constant, fast rate (frequency) with the right values you can produce sounds or
even music!</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#real-time-clock-rtc" id="real-time-clock-rtc">Real Time Clock (RTC)</a></h3>
<p>This peripheral can be used to track time in &quot;human format&quot;. Seconds, minutes,
hours, days, months and years. This peripheral handles the translation from
&quot;ticks&quot; to these human friendly units of time. It even handles leap years and
Daylight Save Time for you!</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#other-communication-protocols" id="other-communication-protocols">Other communication protocols</a></h3>
<p>SPI, I2S, SMBUS, CAN, IrDA, Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, etc.</p>
<p>Different applications use different communication protocols. User facing
applications usually have an USB connector because USB is an ubiquitous
protocol in PCs and smartphones. Whereas inside cars you'll find plenty of CAN
&quot;buses&quot;. Some digital sensors use SPI, others use I2C and others, SMBUS.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#general-embedded-relevant-topics" id="general-embedded-relevant-topics">General Embedded-Relevant Topics</a></h2>
<p>These topics cover items that are not specific to our device, or the hardware on
it. Instead, they discuss useful techniques that could be used on embedded
systems.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#gyroscopes" id="gyroscopes">Gyroscopes</a></h3>
<p>As part of our Punch-o-meter exercise, we used the Accelerometer to measure
changes in acceleration in three dimensions. Our board also features a sensor
called a Gyroscope, which allows us to measure changes in &quot;spin&quot; in three
dimensions.</p>
<p>This can be very useful when trying to build certain systems, such as a robot
that wants to avoid tipping over. Additionally, the data from a sensor like a
gyroscope can also be combined with data from accelerometer using a technique
called Sensor Fusion (see below for more information).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#servo-and-stepper-motors" id="servo-and-stepper-motors">Servo and Stepper Motors</a></h3>
<p>While some motors are used primarily just to spin in one direction or the other,
for example driving a remote control car forwards or backwards, it is sometimes
useful to measure more precisely how a motor rotates.</p>
<p>Our microcontroller can be used to drive Servo or Stepper motors, which allow
for more precise control of how many turns are being made by the motor, or
can even position the motor in one specific place, for example if we wanted to
move the arms of a clock to a particular direction.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#sensor-fusion" id="sensor-fusion">Sensor fusion</a></h3>
<p>The STM32F3DISCOVERY contains three motion sensors: an accelerometer, a
gyroscope and a magnetometer. On their own these measure: (proper) acceleration,
angular speed and (the Earth's) magnetic field. But these magnitudes can be
&quot;fused&quot; into something more useful: a &quot;robust&quot; measurement of the orientation of
the board. Where robust means with less measurement error than a single sensor
would be capable of.</p>
<p>This idea of deriving more reliable data from different sources is known as
sensor fusion.</p>

<p>So where to next? There are several options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could check out the examples in the <a href="https://docs.rs/f3"><code>f3</code></a> board support crate. All those examples work for
the STM32F3DISCOVERY board you have.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You could try out <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/japaricious/status/962770003325005824">this motion sensors demo</a>. Details about the implementation and
source code are available in <a href="http://blog.japaric.io/wd-1-2-l3gd20-lsm303dlhc-madgwick/">this blog post</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You could check out <a href="https://docs.rs/cortex-m-rtfm">Real Time for The Masses</a>. A very efficient preemptive multitasking framework
that supports task prioritization and dead lock free execution.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You could try running Rust on a different development board. The easiest way to get started is to
use the <a href="https://docs.rs/cortex-m-quickstart/0.2.4/cortex_m_quickstart"><code>cortex-m-quickstart</code></a> Cargo project template.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You could check out <a href="http://blog.japaric.io/brave-new-io/">this blog post</a> which describes how Rust type system can
prevent bugs in I/O configuration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You could check out my <a href="http://blog.japaric.io">blog</a> for miscellaneous topics about embedded development with Rust.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You could check out the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal"><code>embedded-hal</code></a> project which aims to build abstractions (traits) for all
the embedded I/O functionality commonly found on microcontrollers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You could join the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/39">Weekly driver initiative</a> and help us write generic drivers on top of the
<code>embedded-hal</code> traits and that work for all sorts of platforms (ARM Cortex-M, AVR, MSP430, RISCV,
etc.)</li>
